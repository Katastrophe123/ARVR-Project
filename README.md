# ARVR-Project
Augmented Reality (AR) has revolutionized the gaming industry by bridging the gap between the digital 
and physical worlds. The project Car City AR Game leverages this cutting-edge technology to create an 
interactive and immersive gaming experience. Built using Unity, one of the most versatile game 
development platforms, this game brings miniature car simulations to life in real-world settings. 
The Car City AR Game provides users with an engaging environment where they can interact with virtual 
cars, navigate dynamic urban landscapes, and complete challenges seamlessly integrated into their 
surroundings. By combining Unity’s powerful game development tools with AR capabilities, the project 
showcases the potential of AR in enhancing user engagement and redefining traditional gaming 
experiences. 
This report outlines the objectives, design process, development tools, and implementation strategies used 
in creating the Car City AR Game. It also discusses the challenges encountered during the development 
phase and the solutions adopted to overcome them, along with an analysis of user feedback and future 
scope for enhancements.
For our project, we wanted to dive into Virtual Reality, and we figured the best way to learn 
was to build something interactive from scratch. We decided to create a classic VR Shooting 
Game. The main goal wasn't to make a highly polished or complex game, but to get a solid 
grasp of the fundamentals of VR interaction using the modern Unity tools. 
The core concept is simple: the player is placed in a basic 3D environment while wearing a VR 
headset. They hold a virtual gun, which is tracked to their right-hand controller. When they pull 
the controller's trigger, the gun fires a physics-based bullet. The goal is to shoot and destroy the 
target cubes that are scattered around the scene. Every time a cube is hit, it disappears, and the 
player's score—which is displayed on a floating UI screen—goes up by one.
